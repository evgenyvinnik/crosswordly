# Crosswordly

Crosswordly is a five-letter word puzzle inspired by Wordle aesthetics. This repository currently hosts the initial Vite + React scaffold that will power the game.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

The project is pre-configured for GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package. Run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The deploy script builds the project with the correct base path (`/crosswordly/`) before publishing the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.
